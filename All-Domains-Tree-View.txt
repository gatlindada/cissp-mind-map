    Identifying Vulnerabilities and Threats
    Methodologies for Risk Assessment
      NIST SP 800-30, Revision 1.
        1. Prepare for the assessment.
        2. Conduct the assessment:
          a. Identify threat sources and events.
          b. Identify vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions.
          c. Determine likelihood of occurrence.
          d. Determine magnitude of impact.
          e. Determine risk.
        3. Communicate results.
        4. Maintain assessment.
      Facilitated Risk Analysis Process(FRAP)
        qualitative methodology
        FRAP is intended to be used to analyze one system, application, or business process at a time
      OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)
        OCTAVE would be used to assess all systems, applications, and business processes within the organization.
      AS/NZS ISO 31000
        takes a much broader approach to risk management
        Australian and New Zealand methodology
      ISO/IEC 27000 Series
        ISO/IEC 27005
      Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA)
        FMEA is commonly used in product development and operational environments.
        The goal is to identify where something is most likely going to break and either fix the flaws
        steps
          1. Start with a block diagram of a system or control.
          2. Consider what happens if each block of the diagram fails.
          3. Draw up a table in which failures are paired with their effects and an evaluation of the effects.
          4. Correct the design of the system, and adjust the table until the system is not known to have unacceptable problems.
          5. Have several engineers review the Failure Modes and Effect Analysis.
      fault tree analysis
        • False alarms
        • Insufficient error handling
        • Sequencing or order
        • Incorrect timing outputs
        • Valid but not expected outputs
      CRAMM(Central Computing and Telecommunications Agency Risk Analysis and Management Method)
        was created by the United Kingdom
        three distinct stages

    Risk Analysis Approaches
      Automated Risk Analysis Methods
      Steps of a Quantitative Risk Analysis
        Asset Value × Exposure Factor (EF) = SLE
        SLE × Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) = ALE
      Results of a Quantitative Risk Analysis
        • Monetary values assigned to assets
        • Comprehensive list of all significant threats
        • Probability of the occurrence rate of each threat
        • Loss potential the company can endure per threat in a 12-month time span
        • Recommended controls
    Qualitative Risk Analysis
      qualitative methods walk through different scenarios of risk possibilities and rank the seriousness of the threats and the validity of the different possible countermeasures based on opinions
      The Delphi Technique
        a group decision method
    Protection Mechanisms
      Control Selection
        a cost/benefit analysis.
          (ALE before implementing safeguard) – (ALE after implementing safeguard) – (annual cost of safeguard) = value of safeguard to the company
        Security Control Assessment
    Total Risk vs. Residual Risk
      threats × vulnerability × asset value = total risk
      total risk (threats × vulnerability × asset value) × controls gap = residual risk
      total risk – countermeasures = residual risk

          (SLA) is a contractual agreement that states that a service provider guarantees a certain level of service.
  Risk Management Frameworks
    Commonly Accepted Risk Management Frameworks
      • NIST RMF (SP 800-37r1)
        It takes a systems life-cycle approach to risk management and focuses on certification and accreditation of information systems
        six-step process of applying the RMF
          1. Categorize information system.
          2. Select security controls.
          3. Implement security controls.
          4. Assess security controls.
          5. Authorize information system.
          6. Monitor security controls.
      • ISO 31000:2018
        this framework is not focused on information systems, but can be applied more broadly to an organization.
      • ISACA Risk IT
        it is very well integrated with COBIT

        • Provide an abstraction level for programmers
        • Maximize performance with the limited amount of memory available
        • Protect the operating system and applications loaded into memory
      five basic responsibilities
        Relocation
          • Swap contents from RAM to the hard drive as needed
          • Provide pointers for applications if their instructions and memory segment have been moved to a different location in main memory
        Protection
          • Limit processes to interact only with the memory segments assigned to them
          • Provide access control to memory segments
        Sharing
          • Use complex controls to ensure integrity and confidentiality when processes need to use the same shared memory segments
          • Allow many users with different levels of access to interact with the same application running in one memory segment
        Logical organization
          • Segment all memory types and provide an addressing scheme for each at an abstraction level
          • Allow for the sharing of specific software modules, such as dynamic link library (DLL) procedures
        Physical organization
          • Segment the physical memory space for application and operating system processes
      Memory Protection Issues
        • Every address reference is validated for protection.
        • Two or more processes can share access to the same segment with potentially different access rights.
        • Different instruction and data types can be assigned different levels of protection.
        • Processes cannot generate an unpermitted address or gain access to an unpermitted segment.

  System Security Architecture
    Security Policy
      is a strategic tool that dictates how sensitive information and resources are to be managed and protected
    Security Architecture Requirements
      trusted computing base (TCB)
        is a collection of all the hardware, software, and firmware components within a system that provides some type of security and enforces the system’s security policy.
      Security Perimeter
        an imaginary boundary
      Reference Monitor
        is an abstract machine that mediates all access subjects have to objects, both to ensure that the subjects have the necessary access rights and to protect the objects from unauthorized access and destructive modification.
        is an access control concept
        referred to as the “reference monitor concept” or an “abstract machine.”
      Security Kernel
        is made up of hardware, software, and firmware components that fall within the TCB, and it implements and enforces the reference monitor concept
        three main requirements
          • It must provide isolation for the processes carrying out the reference monitor concept, and the processes must be tamperproof.
          • It must be invoked for every access attempt and must be impossible to circumvent. Thus, the security kernel must be implemented in a complete and foolproof way.
          • It must be small enough to be tested and verified in a complete and comprehensive manner.
        The TCB is the totality of protection mechanisms within a computer system that work together to enforce a security policy
  Security Models
    Bell-LaPadula Model(1970s)
      enforces the confidentiality aspects of access control
      is called a multilevel security system
      it provides and addresses confidentiality only
      Three main rules
        • Simple security rule
          no read up
        • *-property (star property) rule
          no write down
        • Strong star property rule
          states that a subject who has read and write capabilities can only perform both of those functions at the same security level
    Biba Model
      is a security model that addresses the integrity of data within a system
      three main rules
        • *-integrity axiom
          no write up
        • Simple integrity axiom
          no read down
        • Invocation property
          A subject cannot request service (invoke) at a higher integrity.
    Clark-Wilson Model
      protecting the integrity of information
      elements
        • Users Active agents
        • Transformation procedures (TPs) Programmed abstract operations, such as read, write, and modify
        • Constrained data items (CDIs) Can be manipulated only by TPs
        • Unconstrained data items (UDIs) Can be manipulated by users via primitive read and write operations
        • Integrity verification procedures (IVPs) Check the consistency of CDIs with external reality
    Noninterference Model
      to ensure any actions that take place at a higher security level do not affect, or interfere with, actions that take place at a lower level
      Covert Channels
        is a way for an entity to receive information in an unauthorized manner
        storage
        timing
    Brewer and Nash Model
      also called the Chinese Wall model
      states that a subject can write to an object if, and only if, the subject cannot read another object that is in a different dataset.
      The main goal of the model is to protect against conflicts of interest by users’ access attempts.
    Graham-Denning Model
      define
        addresses some of these issues and defines a set of basic rights in terms of commands that a specific subject can execute on an object.
      rules
        • How to securely create an object
        • How to securely create a subject
        • How to securely delete an object
        • How to securely delete a subject
        • How to securely provide the read access right
        • How to securely provide the grant access right
        • How to securely provide the delete access right
        • How to securely provide transfer access rights
    Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman Mode(HRU)
      This model shows how a finite set of procedures can be available to edit the access rights of a subject.
      HRU model is used by software designers to ensure that no unforeseen vulnerability is introduced and the stated access control goals are achieved

    Best Practices for Securing WLANs
      Change the default SSID. Each AP comes with a preconfigured default SSID value.
      • Implement WPA2 and 802.1X to provide centralized user authentication (e.g., RADIUS, Kerberos). Before users can access the network, require them to authenticate.
      • Use separate VLANs for each class of users, just as you would on a wired LAN.
      • If you must support unauthenticated users (e.g., visitors), ensure they are connected to an untrusted VLAN that remains outside your network’s perimeter.
      • Deploy a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS).
      • Physically put the AP at the center of the building. The AP has a specific zone of coverage it can provide.
      • Logically put the AP in a DMZ with a firewall between the DMZ and internal network.
      Allow the firewall to investigate the traffic before it gets to the wired network.
      • Implement VPN for wireless devices to use. This adds another layer of protection for data being transmitted.
      • Configure the AP to allow only known MAC addresses into the network. Allow only known devices to authenticate. But remember that these MAC addresses are sent in cleartext, so an attacker could capture them and masquerade himself as an authenticated device.
      • Carry out penetration tests on the WLAN. Use the tools described in this section to identify APs and attempt to break the current encryption scheme being used.

              • They provide more protection than circuit-level proxy firewalls.
              • They require more processing per packet and thus are slower than circuit-level proxy firewalls.
        • Dynamic packet filtering
          ACLs
          it gives you the option of allowing any type of traffic outbound and permitting only response traffic inbound.
        • Kernel proxy
          a fifth-generation firewall.
          faster than application-level proxy firewalls because all of the inspection and processing takes place in the kernel and does not need to be passed up to a higher software layer in the operating system.

          The Kerberos Authentication Process
          Weaknesses of Kerberos
            • The KDC can be a single point of failure.
            • The KDC must be able to handle the number of requests it receives in a timely manner. It must be scalable.
            • Secret keys are temporarily stored on the users’ workstations, which means it is possible for an intruder to obtain these cryptographic keys.
            • Session keys are decrypted and reside on the users’ workstations, either in a cache or in a key table. Again, an intruder can capture these keys.
            • Kerberos is vulnerable to password guessing.
            • Network traffic is not protected by Kerberos if encryption is not enabled.
            • If the keys are too short, they can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
            • Kerberos needs all client and server clocks to be synchronized.

  Assessment, Test, and Audit Strategies
    Information System Security Audit Process
      1. Determine the goals, because everything else hinges on this.
      2. Involve the right business unit leaders to ensure the needs of the business are identified and addressed.
      3. Determine the scope, because not everything can be tested.
      4. Choose the audit team, which may consist of internal or external personnel, depending on the goals, scope, budget, and available expertise.
      5. Plan the audit to ensure all goals are met on time and on budget.
      6. Conduct the audit while sticking to the plan and documenting any deviations therefrom.
      7. Document the results, because the wealth of information generated is both valuable and volatile.
      8. Communicate the results to the right leaders in order to achieve and sustain a strong security posture.

        5. Report to management Delivering to management documentation of test findings along with suggested countermeasures
      varying degrees of knowledge
        • Zero knowledge The team does not have any knowledge of the target and must start from ground zero.
        • Partial knowledge The team has some information about the target.
        • Full knowledge The team has intimate knowledge of the target.

          • Applicability at every level, including that of individual, agency, and country
        principles
          1. When dealing with digital evidence, all of the general forensic and procedural principles must be applied.
          2. Upon the seizing of digital evidence, actions taken should not change that evidence.
          3. When it is necessary for a person to access original digital evidence, that person should be trained for the purpose.
          4. All activity relating to the seizure, access, storage, or transfer of digital evidence must be fully documented, preserved, and available for review.
          5. An individual is responsible for all actions taken with respect to digital evidence while the digital evidence is in their possession.
          6. Any agency that is responsible for seizing, accessing, storing, or transferring digital evidence is responsible for compliance with these principles.
